corona3d_2020 aims to be a flexible planetary exosphere modeling program, able to handle
multiple particle types with a variety of initial distribution options and background
species profiles. See the sample 'corona3d_2020.cfg' file under the 'src' folder for
details on the currently available configuration parameter options.

The current version of this software is focused on calculating the escaping fraction of Hot H
atoms from Mars due to the dissociative recombination of HCO+. However, with slight modifications
to the configuration file, it can also use the symmetric charge exchange of H with H+ as the source
of hot H. There are also atmospheric profiles for Venus available in the inputs folder.
