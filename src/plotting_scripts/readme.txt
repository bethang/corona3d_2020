Readme file for escape estimate running and plotting scripts.

To estimate escape energies, run 'calculate_weighted_escape_estimate.py' eith option 1.

The script 'fit_escape_prob' takes the model-generated escape probabilities (inmodel_output_data directory) and returns fitted curves.

The script 'weighted_esc_pie.py' is used by 'calculate_weighted_escape_estimate' to plot Figure 4 of Gregory et al. (2023), "Nonthermal hydrogen loss at Mars: Contributions of photochemical mechanisms to escape and identification of key processes."

Note that "plot_Figure1abc," "plot_Figure2," and "plot_Figure3" refer to Gregory et al. (2023a).
